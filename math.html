<p> Unlike most, Math is my most absolutely favorite subject. It's uses, functions and variations of complexity show the detailed design of our Creator.
For instance, isn't it crazy that Ï€'s digits go on forever? Just think of all those numbers. And also think about how some infinities can be bigger than others.
Furthermore, thinks about Imaginary Numbers and their use in astronomy and geometry. Then just picture the infinite intricacy of Mandelbrot Sets. Also, about 
the surprising usefulness of Pascal's triangle... Oh! and don't forget Mersenne Primes and Chaos Theory and so much more. </p>
