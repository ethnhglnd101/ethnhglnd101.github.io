    <p> One of my favorite things about LOTR ( Lord Of the Rings) is that it is long so if I watch it at night I get to stay up late. Also I like the adventure and the danger. I don't really mind the ugly creatures (orcs, cave trolls, Nazgul ect.) </p>
    <p> If you want to see my favorite characters from LOTR I have a <a href="_my_favorite_LOTR_characters.html">special page</a> (click on special page) just for that! </p>
