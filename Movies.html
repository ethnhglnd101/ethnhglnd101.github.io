<h1> Movies </h1>



<p> Like most people, I like movies. Some of these films are Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and some Avengers Movies. </p>


<p>   STAR WARS is one of my favorite set of movies. So far, I have watched Episodes 1,2 [not three], Rogue One, 4,5,6,7,8 and 9. Another one of my favorite movies are 
Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings is a very well done movies unlike the Hobbit where it's just injected with other nonsense. It is pretty cool because of the action and that there 
is no language in it. </p>

<p> In addition, I also like Avengers: Endgame. Its use of time travel is in a fun way: frustrating. Despite this, it does have some language.
