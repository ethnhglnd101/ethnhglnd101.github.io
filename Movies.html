<h1> Movies </h1>



<p> Like most people, I like movies. Some of these films are Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and some Avengers Movies. </p>


<p>   STAR WARS is one of my favorite set of movies. So far, I have watched Episodes 1,2 [not three], Rogue One, 4,5,6,7,8 and 9. Another one of my favorite movies are 
Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings is a very well done movies unlike the Hobbit where it's just injected with other nonsense. It is pretty cool because of the action and that there 
is <a href="<img src="slack-imgs-1.gif"

<p> In addition, I also like Avengers: Endgame.
         Its use of time travel is in a fun way: frustrating. Despite this, it does have some language.

         <p> Finally, another movie, yet not known by most is Interstellar (by Christopher Nolan). This fun movie involves Relativity (Time warps), space and is an all 'round
                  great movie. </p>
