<h1> Argos </h1> 


<p> This is Argos. Argos is a cat. I am writing like Dr. Suess. Dr. Suess liked cats. Cats are Argos' kind.  [wierdness] </p>

<p> Sorry about the â€¦ Dr. Suessitis up there but yeah, Argos is my cat. The story of how we came to receiving him: 
  
  Once upon a Track Meet [which if you do track you know how long they are], my dad happened to start talking with one of my friend's dad about rodent problems. 
  As the conversation continued, my friend's Dad mentioned that his cat had given birth to 3 kittens of which one could be given to us. He will be given to us Late June-Early July. </p>









<p> This page will be updated on the details of the story </p>
