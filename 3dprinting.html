<h1> 3D Printing </h1> 

<p> I recently purchased a 3D printer! It is an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comgrow-Creality-Ender-Aluminum-220x220x250mm/dp/B07BR3F9N6/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1UXKSWGINVM30&keywords=ender+3&qid=1644098845&sprefix=ender+3%2Caps%2C370&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQ0RaODVTNUZDS0gmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0NDY2MjkzNkFQOVhUN0hMNTc5JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxMjc0MDlFWEc2V1BKT0ZGWjkmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl">Ender 3</a>
  . The printers dimensions are 235mm x 235mm x 250mm. This is a decent-sized printer for the price i bought it for. When it finally arrived, one of my first projects 
  was to print custom LEGO compatible machine guns and such. My original plan with this 3d printer was to print the full stormtrooper armor, however, to conserve time, space and money ($$$), I decided
  to print the Scout Trooper Armor, <a href="https://i.etsystatic.com/15583754/r/il/cd01c8/2193856543/il_794xN.2193856543_kvvo.jpg">Blaster</a> and Helmet. If you want to see continual progress and updates on this armor,
  click on the "Scout Trooper Armor" link at the top of you screen. If you are reading this, you most likely know me, so shoot me a message if you ever want me to 3d Print you something.
