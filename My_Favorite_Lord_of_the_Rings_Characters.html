  <ol>
    <li class="backround">Frodo, the annoying person who spills half the water bottle when he drinks from a skin sac in Mordor. </li>
    <img src="pictures/Frodo_Baggins.png"
          alt="Frodo Baggins">

    <li class="backround">Gandalf … famous quote, "I have not gone through fire and death to face the likes of you (enemy), you wormtongue." Along the lines of that. :) </li>
    <img src="pictures/Gandalf_The_White.png"
         alt="Gandalf the White">

    <li class="backround">Legolas (no comment, his amazingness is self-explanatory) </li>
    <img src="pictures/Legolas600ppx.jpg"
          alt="Legolas">

    <li class="backround">Samwise Gamgee (Hero of them all) </li>
    <img src="pictures/200px-Sean_Astin_as_Samwise_Gamgee.png"
         alt="Sam Gamgee">

    <li class="backround">Aragorn</li>
    <img src="pictures/Aragorn.png"
         alt="Aragorn">

    <li class="backround"> Peregrin Took (Pippin) Honestly, this hobbit is a stinker, he eats everything and litterally does whatever he wants (e.g. throws a skeleton down the well to wake up the orcs and ruin the whole mission and cost them the life of Gandalf)</li>
    <img src="pictures/Pippin.png"
         alt="Peregrin Took">

    <li class="backround"> Merriadoc Brandybuck (Merry) Exactly like Pippin except that he kills the Witch King. </li>
    <img src="pictures/Merry.png"
         alt="Merry">

    <li class="backround"> Gimli (the natural comedian character of this dwarf is outstandingly apparent) </li>
    <img src="pictures/250px-Gimli_With_Axe.jpg"
         alt="Gimli">

    <li class="backround">Faramir (no comment, resmebles Eoqwyn (whom he marries) which is not surprising) </li>
    <img src="pictures/Faramir.png"
         alt="Faramir">

    <li class="backround"> Boromir, one does not simply not have Boromir in his favorite character list.  </li>
    <img src="pictures/Boromir.png"
         alt="Boromir">
    <img src="pictures/Boromir.jpeg"
        alt="Boromir">

    <li class="backround"> Theoden, "Where was Gondor?" Aragorn, "In Gondor." Aragorn's literary genius is simply shown in this fake conversation.</li>
    <img src="pictures/220px-Theoden600ppx.png"
         alt="Theoden">

    <li class="backround"> Eomer (no comment)</li>
    <img src="pictures/200px-EomerFilm.JPG"
         alt="Eomer">

    <li class="backround"> And no I don't like Denethor. He is nuts. Burning his son?! Child Abuse bro!</li>
    <img src="pictures/Denethor.png"
         alt="Denethor">

    <li class="backround"> Eowyn (good fighter, but terrible cook, though she is a suitable wife for Faramir they are kinda similar. I mean even Aragorn couldn't eat her (disgusting) food.)  </li>
          
          <img src="Éowyn_with_sword.jpg"
         alt="eowyn">
  
         

    
    
     <li class="backround"> Treebeard, I like when he says, "Whose side am I on? I am on no one's side because no one is altogether on my side." My kinda dude. </li>
          <img src="220px-Treebeard.jpg"
         alt="Treebeard">
  
    
         
        <li class="backround"> Elrond very wise, maybe a little too much...I also like when Frodo is in Rivendell and Gandalf is taliking about the battle against Sauron, and Elrond is like, " Yes Gandalf, I was there, 3000 yrs ago." (Pretty insane eh?)   </li>  
          <img src="180px-Elrond11.jpg"
         alt="Elrond">
   
          
    
        </ol>
