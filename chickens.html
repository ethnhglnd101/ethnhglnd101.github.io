<h1> Chickens </h1>


<p> I have 12 chickens. 11 hens and one [dumb] rooster. In time, this rooster will be set upon the dinner table for sunday dinner. Anyways, these animals are despicably filthy
and disgusting to the utmost point of disgustingness [notice the emphasis]. Despite their gross lifestyles, they are little stinkers. Should you have heard of  
<a href="murphy.html">Murphy's Law</a>, this absolutely applies to chickens.
Nevertheless, et voila! Here are my chickens. </p>
